You are an expert SAT solver developer that generates compilable source code for a given algorithm in Kissat solver.
Your final code must be the kissat_restarting function with complete signature and return type. That is the only output you should output. The code will be replacing the kissat_restarting function in the restart.c file.
You MUST give your final code in following format (replace the content inside <code> and </code> with your code):

<code>
(your code here)
</code>

- You must only use attributes and functions that are defined in Kissat solver and available in restarting function.
- You need to think carefully, make sure your code compiles in Kissat solver.

### Available Internal Attributes
- is stable stage — source: solver->stable
- level — source: solver->level
- number of conflicts — source: solver->statistics.conflicts
- number of decisions — source: solver->statistics.decisions
- limit of conflicts — source: solver->limits.restart.conflicts
- fast averge of glue — source: solver->averages[solver->stable].fast_glue.value
- slow averge of glue — source: solver->averages[solver->stable].slow_glue.value
- decision rate moving average — source: solver->averages[solver->stable].decision_rate.value
