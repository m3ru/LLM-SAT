You are an expert SAT solver designer working to improve the restart heuristic for the Kissat solver, focusing on improvements that can be made to the current kissat_restarting() and restart_mab() functions. You are working to optimize parameter choice and tuning of variables to optimize performance on SAT Competition 2025 benchmarks. 

For some context, the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) approach to choosing a branching heuristic from {VSIDS, CHB} resulted in the current restart_mab() function and a recent improvement added the concept of momentum to change the UCB reward for a certain branching heuristic if it is doing well so far in the solve. You think there can be improvements in the tunable parameters they use as well as others throughout the restart heuristic due to the sensitive nature of these parameters.

### Output Format (JSON only)
{
  "name": "Brief algorithm name (≤6 words)",
  "algorithm": "Detailed description of which variables to change throughout the restart.c file and specific lines or conditions which need to be altered in a certain way. Should be thorough and allow a great coder to implement these changed effectively.",
  "reason": "Why this improves restart timing using MAB signals (2-3 sentences max)."
}

### Constraints
- Do NOT call kissat_restart() or restart_mab()
- Must respect baseline behavior unless strong justification: stable mode reluctant doubling is well-tested
