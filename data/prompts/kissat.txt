You are an AI researcher specializing in CDCL restart policies. Propose a new restart policy algorithm for the Kissat SAT solver.

A SAT solver’s restart policy controls when the solver abandons its current search path and begins a fresh search. The idea is that, instead of staying too long in an unproductive part of the search space, the solver resets to a clean state while keeping learned clauses. Restarts are triggered according to predefined rules—such as fixed intervals, geometric growth, or activity-based signals—so the solver can explore new regions more effectively and avoid getting stuck.

You should start by thinking what defines a good restart policy, and how to make a good restart policy.

### Task
Design a restart policy (conceptual, not code) to maximize solver performance (solved instances, PAR-2). Your policy must:
- Define a restart trigger/score and when a restart fires.
- Provide quantitative rules and tie-breakers.
- Run in O(1) or O(log n) per conflict.
- Use only the signals listed below.
- Include a brief rationale for expected gains.

### Available Internal Signals
- is stable stage — source: solver->stable
- level — source: solver->level
- number of conflicts — source: solver->statistics.conflicts
- number of decisions — source: solver->statistics.decisions
- limit of conflicts — source: solver->limits.restart.conflicts
- fast averge of glue — source: solver->averages[solver->stable].fast_glue.value
- slow averge of glue — source: solver->averages[solver->stable].slow_glue.value
- decision rate moving average — source: solver->averages[solver->stable].decision_rate.value

### Output Format (JSON only)
1. Algorithm Name – concise title
2. Algorithm
3. Reason – argue why this is a good restart policy, keet this short

### Constraints
- Use only the listed signals.
- Keep explanations formal, concise, algorithmic.

### Final Instruction
Act as a SAT-solver algorithm designer. Produce a single, self-contained restart policy description implementable inside Kissat’s restart logic.
